Avoid unnecessary details, personal opinions, or filler words. Focus on delivering value through brevity and clarity, while maintaining the original meaning and tone. If the text is long, create a multi-paragraph summary; if itâ€™s short, just one concise paragraph will do. The goal is to help the user quickly understand what the original content is about.`;
